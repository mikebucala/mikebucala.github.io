                About Hillary 
            </h2>
            <p>
                Hillary started her business in highschool. At first she made things only for her friends and herself but more and more people at her highschool were asking for her to make them different things. She saw 
                a business opportunity and she ended up creating Ham's Creations. Since then she has been making different things for customers all around North Carolina.
