            <p>
                I, John M. Bucala agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my FALL 2022, ITIS3135, Web Application Design and Development
                with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.     
            </p>

            <p>
                I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, and will not put
                information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
            </p>

            <p>
                I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments 
                may show as absences.
            </p>

            <p>
                I also understand that given the structure and content of this class its possible to find many examples online or even view my classmates code
                directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit 
                (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates.
            </p>
