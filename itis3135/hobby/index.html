                    <p>
                        Lacrosse is a sport that is very similar to hockey. Two teams of 10 players play a total of 4 quarters. The goal of the game is to score points by
                        throwing the lacrosse ball into the opposing teams net. The game starts with a face off. A face off is when two opposing players line up in front of each 
                        other at center field and when the referee blows the whistle both players try to get the ball simultaneously.
