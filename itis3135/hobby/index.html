                        What is Lacrosse ?
                    </h2>

                    <h3>
                        Lacrosse is a sport that is very similar to hockey in a lot of ways. Two teams of 10 players play a total of 4 quarters. The goal of the game is to score points by
                        throwing the lacrosse ball into the opposing teams net. Each team has 1 goalie, 3 defenders, 3 mid-fielders, and 3 attackers. The game starts with a face off. A face off is when two opposing players line up in front of each 
                        other at center field and when the referee blows the whistle both players try to get the ball simultaneously. Now lets talk some about the rules of lacrosse.

                    <h3>
                        The rules of lacrosse are very similar to hockeys rules. Every player can be penalized and placed in the penalty box for a varying amount of time (depending on the
                        severity of the penalty) leaving their team down a man. Here are a list of a couple of different penalties and what causes them:

                    <h3>
                        I played lacrosse in highschool for 3 years. Throughout my three years I played as a defenseman for my highschool. I was by no means a prodigy at lacrosse 
                        but I wasn't terrible at it. I mainly just played to have fun with my friends throughout highschool but we fell in love with the game and wanted to be good.
                        After a lot of hard work and pushing through medical issues, I wasn't half bad at the end of my high school lacrosse "carrer". I enjoyed learning a new sport 
                        and competing together on a team with my friends. I learned not only how to play the game of lacrosse but important life skills too such has: no matter how many times
                        you're knocked over, you have to get back up and keep fighting.

                        One of the best times I got to experience while playing lacrosse at my high school was beating one of our rivals in our last game of my senior year. My senior 
                        year was cut short due to COVID-19 and this game happened the day before my school went completely online. We thought that we were only going to be online for about two 
                        weeks and it was going to be a little vacation for us, we had no idea that after that day our lives and many others would be changed forever. After a long back and
                        forth game, we came out with the win. At least for many of the seniors in my class look back on that day fondly.

                        year, we lost almost every game we played not because they were a lot better than us, but most of our players were new and would make simple mistakes. With a

                        How lacrosse began 
                    </h2>
                    <h3>
                        Lacrosse was created and first played by Native Americans. Lacrosse began as a game know to them as stickball. The original game of lacrosse was played over huge stretches of open fields that were
                        sometimes miles long. There was no "out of bounds" and the only rule was not to tough the ball with your hands.The game would start by someone throwing the ball 
                        into the air (instead of a faceoff) and someone catching it or getting it off the ground. Lacrosse was eventually shown to french missionaries who spread lacrosse
                        to other regions of the world.

                    <h2>
                        Why did the Native Americans start playing lacrosse 
                    </h2>
                    <h3>
                        The Native Americans started playing lacrosse as a way to train and "harden" warriors within their tribe. They would play lacrosse to settle disputes between tribes,
                        or even just for recreation or religious resasons. The way Native Americans played lacrosse back then was a lot different from the way it is played now. There were no 
                        rules beside using your stick instead of your hands. This led to a much more extreme and violent version of lacrosse and was the reason it was used to train warriors.
